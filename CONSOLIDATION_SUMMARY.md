**Date:** October 20, 2025  
**Action:** Consolidated multiple markdown files into single comprehensive document

## What Was Done

‚úÖ **Created:** `CONSOLIDATED_DOCUMENTATION.md` (342KB)
- Merged 37 individual markdown files
- Organized into 9 major sections
- Maintained all original content
- Added table of contents with navigation links

‚úÖ **Archived:** 44 files moved to `_archived_docs/20251020_171213/`
- All archived files remain accessible as backup
- Original directory structure preserved in archive
- Can be restored if needed

‚úÖ **Kept:** Essential files remain
- `README.md` - Main project README for GitHub
- `tinko-console/README.md` - Frontend README  
- `CONSOLIDATED_DOCUMENTATION.md` - New master document
- System files (.github, .specify, etc.)

## Results

### Before:
- **101 total markdown files** scattered across project
- Multiple overlapping/redundant documentation
- Difficult to find specific information
- Hard to maintain consistency

### After:
- **1 consolidated documentation file** (342KB)
- **57 remaining .md files** (mostly system/config files)
- Clear organization with 9 sections
- Easy to search and navigate
- All content preserved and backed up

## Sections in Consolidated Documentation

1. **Project Overview** - Main README content
2. **Quick Start Guides** - PSP-001 and Retry guides
3. **Implementation Status** - Phase completions, summaries, status reports
4. **Architecture & Design** - Partition strategy, observability
5. **Deployment & Operations** - Deployment guides, Docker, demo data
6. **Testing & Quality** - Test checklists, reports, phase summaries
7. **Frontend (Tinko Console)** - Frontend docs, architecture, components, theme
8. **Specifications** - Product specs and validations
9. **Changelog & Reports** - Changelog, delivery reports, phase summaries

## How to Use

```

### Search for Content:

```

## Scripts Created
