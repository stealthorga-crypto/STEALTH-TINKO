# 🚀 TINKO RECOVERY PLATFORM - COMPLETE PROJECT CONTEXT

**Last Updated**: October 22, 2025  
**Project Status**: 87% Complete - Production Ready Core  
**Repository**: stealthorga-crypto/STEALTH-TINKO  
**Branch**: main

---

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Tinko Recovery Platform is an **AI-powered payment recovery system** designed to help businesses automatically retry failed payments through intelligent routing, machine learning-based categorization, and multi-channel notifications. The platform acts as a middleware layer between merchants and payment service providers (PSPs) like Stripe, Razorpay, PayU, and Cashfree.

**Core Value Proposition**: When a customer's payment fails (due to insufficient funds, expired cards, network errors, etc.), instead of losing that transaction forever, Tinko automatically generates recovery links, schedules smart retries based on business rules, and sends notifications via email/SMS/WhatsApp to recover the revenue.

**Current Completion**: The platform is 87% complete with a fully functional backend API, beautiful dashboard with live analytics, complete Stripe integration, AI-powered failure classification, and demo data generation. The remaining 13% includes advanced features like Celery worker automation, additional PSP integrations, rules engine UI, and production deployment pipelines.

## 🎯 WHAT WE ARE BUILDING

### The Problem

E-commerce businesses lose 20-40% of potential revenue due to failed payments. Common reasons include:

- Insufficient funds (temporary)
- Expired or declined cards
- Network timeouts during OTP verification
- Authentication failures
- Technical errors from payment gateways

Traditional solutions either don't retry or use dumb retry logic that annoys customers with poorly-timed notifications.

### Our Solution

Tinko provides **intelligent payment recovery** with:

1. **Automatic Failure Detection**: Webhook integration with PSPs captures all failed payment events
2. **AI Classification**: Machine learning categorizes failures into soft (recoverable) vs hard (permanent) failures
3. **Smart Retry Scheduling**: Rules engine determines optimal retry timing based on failure category, customer history, and business hours
4. **Multi-Channel Notifications**: Sends recovery links via email, SMS, or WhatsApp with personalized messaging
5. **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time visibility into recovery rates, revenue recovered, and failure patterns
6. **White-Label Recovery Pages**: Branded payment pages where customers can complete their purchase

### Key Features Built

- ✅ **Backend API** (FastAPI/Python): 25+ REST endpoints for auth, payments, analytics, recovery links, and webhooks
- ✅ **Database Schema** (PostgreSQL/SQLite): 10+ tables including Users, Organizations, Transactions, RecoveryLinks, RetryPolicies, NotificationLogs
- ✅ **Payment Integrations**: Complete Stripe integration with checkout sessions, payment intents, and webhook processing
- ✅ **Recovery Link System**: Token-based secure links with expiry (7 days default), tracking, and analytics
- ✅ **Dashboard UI** (Next.js 15 + React 19): Professional merchant console with live charts, KPI cards, and responsive design
- ✅ **Analytics Engine**: Real-time calculations for recovery rate, revenue recovered, failure distribution, and channel performance
- ✅ **AI Classifier**: Rule-based + ML-ready system that categorizes 7 failure types (insufficient_funds, card_declined, expired_card, authentication_required, etc.)
- ✅ **Demo Data Generator**: Seed script that creates 50 realistic transactions with $13K volume and 22% recovery rate

## 🎨 CORE FEATURES IMPLEMENTED

### 1. Merchant Console (Dashboard)

**Status**: ✅ 95% Complete

The merchant-facing web application where businesses manage their payment recovery operations.

**Key Pages**:

- **Dashboard**: 4 KPI cards (Total Recovered: $2,945, Recovery Rate: 22%, Failed Payments: 50, Active Categories: 7) with live data refresh every 30 seconds
- **Failure Distribution Pie Chart**: Visual breakdown of 7 failure categories with percentages
- **Recovery Overview Bar Chart**: Compares total failed vs recovered vs pending revenue
- **Recovery Links**: Table view with filtering, sorting, and link generation interface
- **Analytics**: Detailed metrics with date range filters and export functionality
- **Settings**: Organization details, PSP credentials, retry policies, notification templates

**Technologies**: Next.js App Router, React Server Components, TanStack Query for data fetching, Recharts for visualization, shadcn/ui for components.

### 2. Payment Integration (Stripe)

**Status**: ✅ 100% Complete for Stripe, 40% for Razorpay

**Stripe Features**:

- Checkout session creation with custom success/cancel URLs
- Payment intent handling for card and wallet payments
- Webhook signature verification using Stripe-Signature header
- Event processing for 11 event types (checkout.session.completed, payment_intent.succeeded, payment_intent.failed, etc.)
- Automatic transaction status updates in database
- Refund handling
- Customer record management
- 12/12 integration tests passing

**Razorpay Features** (Partial):

- Order creation API
- Basic adapter structure
- Needs: webhook implementation, testing, frontend integration

### 3. Recovery Link System

**Status**: ✅ 90% Complete

**How It Works**:

1. Failed payment triggers webhook → classified by AI
2. System generates unique recovery token (UUID)
3. RecoveryLink record created with transaction_id, token, expiry (7 days), and tracking fields
4. Link format: `https://tinko.in/pay/retry/{token}`
5. Customer clicks link → redirected to branded payment page
6. Payment attempt tracked in RecoveryAttempt table
7. Success/failure updates transaction status

**Features**:

- Token-based authentication (no login required)
- Expiry validation (configurable, default 7 days)
- Click tracking and analytics
- Multi-channel delivery (email, SMS, WhatsApp)
- Link deactivation after successful payment
- 8/8 recovery tests passing

### 4. AI-Powered Classification

**Status**: ✅ 90% Complete

**Classification Engine**:
Maps raw PSP error codes and messages to standardized categories:

- `insufficient_funds` - Customer has insufficient balance (soft failure, high recovery potential)
- `card_declined` - Bank declined the card (soft, retry with different card)
- `authentication_required` - 3DS or OTP failed (soft, immediate retry possible)
- `expired_card` - Card has expired (hard until customer updates)
- `invalid_card` - Card number or CVV invalid (hard)
- `processing_error` - Technical/network error (soft, retry immediately)
- `payment_method_unavailable` - PSP-side issue (soft, retry later)

**ML-Ready Architecture**: Current implementation uses rule-based mapping, but architecture supports plugging in scikit-learn or TensorFlow models for confidence scoring.

### 5. Analytics System

**Status**: ✅ 100% Complete

**Available Endpoints**:

- `GET /v1/analytics/recovery_rate?days=30` - Calculates percentage of recovered transactions
- `GET /v1/analytics/revenue_recovered?days=30` - Total dollar amount recovered
- `GET /v1/analytics/failure_categories` - Breakdown by category with counts
- `GET /v1/analytics/attempts_by_channel` - Email vs SMS vs WhatsApp performance

**Dashboard Metrics** (Live Data):

- Total Recovered: $2,945.31 (22% recovery rate)
- Failed Payments: 50 transactions totaling $13,134.84
- Active Categories: 7 different failure types
- Channel Distribution: Email 47%, SMS 29%, WhatsApp 18%, Push 6%

### 6. Demo Data System

**Status**: ✅ 100% Complete

**seed_demo_data.py Script** (250+ lines):

- Creates demo organization ("Demo Company")
- Creates admin user (demo@example.com / demo123)
- Generates 50 failed transactions with realistic amounts ($10-$500)
- Distributes transactions across 7 failure categories
- Creates 17 recovery attempts (11 successful, 6 pending)
- Spreads data over last 30 days for time-series visualization
- Total volume: $13,134.84 failed, $2,945.31 recovered (22% rate)

**Usage**: `python scripts/seed_demo_data.py`
