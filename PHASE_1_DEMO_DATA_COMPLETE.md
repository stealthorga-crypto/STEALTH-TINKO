# Phase 1 Complete: Demo Data & Analytics âœ…

## What Was Accomplished

### 1. Demo Data Seed Script Created

**File:** `scripts/seed_demo_data.py`

**Features:**

- Creates demo organization ("Demo Company")
- Creates admin user (demo@example.com / demo123)
- Generates 50 failed transactions with realistic data
- Creates 17 recovery attempts (35% target recovery rate)
- Populates with 7 different failure categories
- Uses 4 different recovery channels
- Spreads data over last 30 days for realistic charts

**Execution Results:**

```
Failed Transactions: 50
Recovered Payments:  11
Recovery Rate:       22.0%
Total Failed:        $13,134.84
Total Recovered:     $2,945.31
Pending Recovery:    $10,189.53
```

### 2. Analytics Service Updated

**File:** `app/services/analytics.py`

**Improvements:**

- `get_recovery_rate()`: Now calculates based on transactions, returns proper format
- `get_failure_categories()`: Added percentage calculations
- `get_revenue_recovered()`: Filters by org_id correctly
- `get_attempts_by_channel()`: Added success_rate calculation

**API Responses Now Show:**

```json
{
  "recovery_rate": 0.22,
  "total_failures": 50,
  "recovered": 11,
  "period_days": 30
}
```

```json
{
  "categories": [
    {"category": "payment_method_unavailable", "count": 10, "percentage": 20.0},
    {"category": "expired_card", "count": 9, "percentage": 18.0},
    {"category": "invalid_card", "count": 8, "percentage": 16.0},
    ...
  ]
}
```

- Active Categories: **7** (was fake 3)
- Failed Payments: **50** (was fake 12)

**Failure Categories Panel:**

- payment_method_unavailable: 10 (20%)
- expired_card: 9 (18%)

## What's Next

Now that we have real data, we can move to:

### Phase 2: Enhanced Dashboard with Charts (NEXT)
