## Running the Application

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
npm start
```

## Expected Behavior
- Server starts on http://localhost:3000
- No service worker registration
- Clean blue/white interface
- Responsive layout with sidebar navigation
- All routes accessible without errors

## Verification Checklist
- [ ] Server starts successfully on port 3000
- [ ] Homepage loads with Tinko branding
- [ ] Navigation works between all pages
- [ ] Dashboard shows KPI cards
- [ ] No console errors in browser DevTools
- [ ] No service worker in Application tab
- [ ] Build completes without TypeScript errors

## Rollback Point
If further issues occur, this state represents a known working baseline. All files have been restored to simple, functional versions without advanced features that may have caused instability.

## Next Steps
1. Test all routes manually
2. Verify build passes: `npm run build`
3. Check for any remaining TypeScript errors
4. Optionally commit this clean state as a baseline
