# üéâ PSP-001 Implementation Summary

**Date:** January 18, 2025  
**Status:** ‚úÖ **COMPLETE**  
**Production Readiness:** 70% (increased from 65%)

---

## What Was Built

### 1. **Stripe Payment Service** (`app/services/stripe_service.py`)

Complete Stripe integration service with 6 core methods:

- Payment checkout session creation with 24-hour expiration
- Permanent payment link generation
- Session and payment intent status retrieval
- Customer management
- Webhook signature verification for security

### 2. **Payment API Router** (`app/routers/stripe_payments.py`)

RESTful API with 4 endpoints:

- `POST /v1/payments/stripe/checkout-sessions` - Create hosted checkout
- `POST /v1/payments/stripe/payment-links` - Generate reusable links
- `GET /v1/payments/stripe/sessions/{id}/status` - Check payment status
- `POST /v1/payments/stripe/webhooks` - Handle Stripe events (secured)

### 3. **Database Schema**

Added 6 new fields to `Transaction` model:

- `stripe_payment_intent_id` - Payment tracking (indexed)
- `stripe_checkout_session_id` - Session tracking (indexed)
- `stripe_customer_id` - Customer record (indexed)
- `payment_link_url` - Generated checkout URL
- `customer_email` - Email for notifications
- `customer_phone` - Phone for SMS

### 4. **Notification Integration**

Enhanced `notification_tasks.py` to:

- Auto-include Stripe payment links in recovery emails
- Format professional HTML emails with payment buttons
- Add payment links to SMS with amount/currency
- Pull customer data from transactions automatically

### 5. **Webhook Processing**

Real-time event handlers for:

- `checkout.session.completed` - Marks recovery as completed
- `payment_intent.succeeded` - Logs successful payment
- `payment_intent.payment_failed` - Tracks failed attempts

## Next Steps

PSP-001 is complete and ready for testing. Recommended next tasks:

1. **Start Backend Server** with Stripe credentials
2. **Configure Stripe Webhook** endpoint in Dashboard
3. **Test Payment Flow** end-to-end
4. **Build Frontend UI** in tinko-console:
   - Payment success/cancel pages
   - Status tracking dashboard
   - Receipt display

Then proceed to **RULES-001** (Configurable Recovery Rules) or **TMPL-001** (Template Management).
